# DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

# Project Overview
Dive into the delightful world of "Book Connect," where literary adventures await at your fingertips! Browse, explore, and uncover your next great read from a vast, vibrant collection. Whether you're a fan of thrilling mysteries, epic fantasies, or heartwarming romances, "Book Connect" brings the magic of books directly to you. Happy reading! 

The "Book Connect" project provides an opportunity for students to refine a fully functional version of an application. The focus of this project is to enhance the code's maintainability, extendibility, and readability by applying concepts of objects and functions for abstraction. This will not only streamline future modifications but also consolidate students' understanding of higher-level programming concepts, including documentation, Styleguides, and abstraction principles.

# Project Brief
- **Refactor Existing Code**: Analyse and refactor the given JavaScript and HTML code to improve its structure using objects and functions.
- **Implement Abstraction**: Use abstraction to hide the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. This involves creating more generic functions that can perform tasks in a more flexible way.
- **Documentation**: Write clear comments and documentation for the new code structure to explain the purpose and functionality of code blocks, functions, and objects.
- **Follow Styleguides**: Adhere to established coding conventions and Styleguides to ensure code readability and maintainability.


# Elements included 
**Implement Abstraction:**
- Objects: Defined objects that represent key elements of the application, such as books, authors, and genres. Utilise the provided data (e.g., authors, genres, books) to populate these objects.
- Functions: Created functions that handle repetitive tasks, such as rendering the book list, handling user interactions, and applying filters.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery
- Abstractions: having gone through the experience, I believe my trials and errors led me down a path of great understanding of the importance of abstraction of code. This understanding came with a lot of gained skill and the eventual mastery of the area. Even though most abstractions are a bit of a personal and subjective task based on coding style and preference, I believe I have mastered my own methods of abstraction. 

### Challenges faced 
- Logic: one of my larger challenges at the beginning of this project was understanding the brief itself and concept of abstraction, this led to a slow start and an eventual loss in motivation to continue with the project. However, once this hurdle was overcome then I was able to push through and complete the task.

### Areas of Improvement 
- Energy management: moving forward, I need to improve how I manage the way I spend my energy and learn to pace myself so that I don't burn out easily due to frustration and chasing deadlines with little understanding. 
- Refactoring code: I definitely need to improve my refactoring skills moving forward, I noticed that I had to ask for help on more than one occasion when looking for clarification on the methods I was employing to refactor my code. 

## Overall learning experience
I believe the best word to describe my learning experience for this project is bittersweet; I gained some valuable insights into the world of coding and how I personally code as well, which is a very positive thing, the journey I took to get there wasn't pleasant though. Lack of understanding, frustration, loss in motivation, random bugs, these are only some of the hurdles I had to overcome in order to complete this project and although I was able to gain some perspective into what it actually might mean to be a web developer, I don't I could've prepared enough for the whiplash that came with experience.
